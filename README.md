# academic-notes
Misc. notes from courses I have taken / read up on. Part of a project to type up the notes I have made by hand throughout the years.

These are my interpretations of the material. Mistakes are entirely my own (please do contact me at julian.mak@physics.ox.ac.uk about it) 

Principal acknowledgements:

* The lecturers of the undergraduate MMath course I took at Durham (individual lecturers in document)
* The lecturers of the MAGIC courses I took whilst a PhD student at Leeds
